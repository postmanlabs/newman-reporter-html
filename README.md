# newman-reporter-html
HTML reporter for [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) that provides the information about the collection run in HTML format.
This needs to be used in conjunction with Newman so that it can recognize HTML reporting options.

## Install
> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-html
```

## Usage
In order to enable this reporter, specify `html` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
$ newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r html
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-html-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-html-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter html` and `--reporter-html-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html/blob/develop/lib/template-default.hbs) is used |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-html-template <path>` with `--reporters html` and `--reporter-html-export`.
The [default template](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html/blob/develop/lib/template-default.hbs) is used in all other cases.

#### With Newman as a Library
The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/sample-collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    reporters: 'html',
    reporter: {
        html: {
            export: './htmlResults.html', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: './customTemplate.hbs' // optional, this will be picked up relative to the directory that Newman runs in.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

## Compatibility

| **newman-reporter-html** | **newman** | **node** |
|:------------------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
|          v0.1.0          | >= v3.10.0 | >= v6.x  |
|          v1.0.0          | >= v4.0.0  | >= v6.x  |

## Troubleshooting

### Reporter not found
The reporter and newman must be installed at the same level, the installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise.

### Getting different HTML output
You are most probably getting in-built reporter output used in older versions of newman, Please check the newman's [compatibility](#compatibility) section above.
